Notebooks used on my master's degree, where the main goal is to detect imbalance fault through two experiments. Ther first is to detect faults using CNN. The second is to detect faults using SAC-DM algorithm alongside CNN.

## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used for various tasks. However, with increased usage comes a rise in failures, posing risks to human life and causing environmental damage. This study identifies propeller imbalance faults in Brushless DC (BLDC) motors of UAVs. It compares two fault detection methodologies based on chaotic behavior: the already-known CNN approach, and the novel SAC-DM+CNN approach. Both methods involve acquiring audio signals, generating spectrograms, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Results show that the CNN approach achieves 98.18% accuracy, while the SAC-DM+CNN approach achieves 71.43% accuracy in classifying propeller balance faults.
